# PSoC-MechKeyboard

The aim of this project is to design a functional firmware for custom mechanical keyoards
running on [Cypress-Infineon PSoC micro-controllers](https://www.cypress.com/products/microcontrollers-mcus).
Two different implementations are currently being developed, targeting two different architectures:
- [PSoC 5LP](https://www.cypress.com/products/32-bit-arm-cortex-m3-psoc-5lp), for single-core USB HID Keyboards
- [PSoC 6](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-6-microcontrollers-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4m0), for dual-core BLE HID Keyboards

The kits I'm using for the firmware development are the following ones:
- [CY8CKIT-059](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit-onboard-programmer-and) for PSoC 5LP architecture
- [CY8CPROTO-063-BLE](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-6-ble-prototyping-kit-cy8cproto-063-ble) for PSoC6 architecture
